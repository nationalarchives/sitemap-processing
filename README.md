# sitemap-processing

A clumsy wee script that takes the Yoast generated sitemaps created by our WordPress sites and massages them so that the URLs are correct.

In addition it creates a sitemap-index.xml file that points to these sitemaps and any sitemaps of static content.

Usage
Run the script

```Z:\Websites\sitemaps>perl sitemaps-gen.pl```

Once the script has run it's course copy the files to the /sitemaps/ folder on the web server
